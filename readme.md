# About

The purpose of this repository is to showcase some of the mechanical projects I have worked on.
Each subdirectory represents a different project and contains the relevant CAD files and other assets.
Below are summaries of each project, in no particular order.

## Mach-Zehnder Interferometer

This project is the preliminary result of a collaborative effort between the Stony Brook chapter of the Society of Physics Students leadership to develop a low-cost Mach-Zehnder interferometer kit for educational use.
My focus in the project was to design the frame that holds the mirrors an laser, which required several iterations to dial in tolerances and good communication with the students focusing on the mirrors and laser.
Additionally, I had to design around the limitations of 3D printers, since that is how we manufactured the frames, paying close attention to ease of manufacture to keep the result accessible for potential users that might have inexpensive 3D printers.

The CAD work was done using Onshape, and the design is completely parametric for quick iteration.
It features mostly compliant mechanisms for optical alignment, although as can be seen from the images, three point screw tramming was introduced to the outer mirrors in light of misalignment issues.

## High pressure rinse station

The high pressure rinse station was developed during my internship at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Its purpose is to remove micrometer scale surface contaminates from RHIC and anticipated EIC superconducting electronics.
This had to be accomplished while surviving the corrosive ultra-high purity water, not generating its own particulates to recontaminate the surfaces with, and having very low deflection.

The CAD files, created with Autodesk Inventor, are provided.
Additionally, a poster I made as part of the internship is in the `high-pressure-rinse` subdirectory.
